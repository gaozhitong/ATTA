# ‚öñÔ∏èATTA
Welcome to the official code repository for [*ATTA: Anomaly-aware Test-Time Adaptation for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Segmentation*](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=bGcdjXrU2w) by Zhitong Gao, Shipeng Yan, and Xuming He (NeurIPS 2023). 
This work introduces a novel framework to enhance the robustness of dense out-of-distribution (OOD) detection models against domain shifts through test-time adaptation techniques.

## üåüFeatures
- **Innovative Test-Time Adaptation**: ATTA focuses on adapting models at test time to jointly tackles domain and semantic shifts.
- **Benchmarking on Diverse Datasets**: Extensive evaluation on datasets with simulated and real-world domain shifts to ensure robust performance across varied scenarios.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy integration and testing of different OOD detection methods and adaptation strategies.

## üõ† Preparation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup
Ensure you have the correct environment for running the models. The code has been tested on CUDA 10.1 and 11.3. You can use the provided [conda environment file](environment.yml) for setup.
```python
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Preparation
We support the integration of several existing OOD detection models, such as [Max Logit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11132.pdf) and [PEBAL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12264.pdf).
Follow [setup_pretrained_models.md](docs/setup_pretrained_models.md) to prepare the pretrained checkpoints and set up the path. 
You can also add your own OOD detection models to [method_module.py](lib/method_module.py) with only a few lines of code.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation
We evaluate the method on various OOD segmentation datasets, including those with significant domain shifts and those
without based on RoadAnomaly, SMIYC, and Fishyscapes. Follow [setup_datasets.md](docs/setup_datasets.md) to set up these datasets.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èRunning the Adaptation
After completing the necessary preparations, you are now ready to run the test-time adaptation. Start with the following command:
```bash
# Example command for running our test-time adaptation for PEBAL on the Road Anomaly dataset.
python main.py --cfg 'exp/atta.yaml' --dataset RoadAnomaly --method PEBAL
```
### üîß Choosing Your Configuration
The command includes several parameters you can adjust to fit your specific requirements. Here's how you can change each part:

* `--dataset`: Select the dataset for testing. Replace 'RoadAnomaly' with 'FS_Static', 'FS_LostAndFound', or 'FS_Static_C' to test different datasets. ('FS_Static_C' means the FS Static dataset with added domain-shift.)
* `--method`: Choose the OOD detection method. Replace 'PEBAL' with 'Max_logit', 'Energy', or any other integrated method.
* `--cfg`: Select from different configuration files in the '/exp' directory for various adaptation strategies or baseline configurations, such as 'tent.yaml', 'TBN.yaml', or 'baseline.yaml'.

Here are some examples of how you might configure the command for different scenarios:
```bash
# Using a different adaptation strategy (Tent) with PEBAL on FS_Static_C.
python main.py --cfg 'exp/tent.yaml' --dataset FS_Static_C --method PEBAL
# Direct inference with Max_logit on FS_LostAndFound.
python main.py --cfg 'exp/baseline.yaml' --dataset FS_LostAndFound --method Max_logit
```
By default, the FS_Static_C dataset is generated by applying a mix of domain shifts to images from the FS_Static dataset. If you wish to specify a particular type of domain shift, such as fog, you can use the --trans_type argument.
For example, to apply a fog transformation, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py --cfg 'exp/atta.yaml' --dataset FS_Static_C --method PEBAL --trans_type fog
```
